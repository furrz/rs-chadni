# Chladni Plate Simulator

This is an application that visualizes a square Chladni Plate.
Most parameters must be tweaked at compile-time, but builds using the default parameters are available as
[build artifacts](https://github.com/furrz/rs-chladni/actions) for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

A physical example of what this attempts to model can be seen in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjueHI002Fg).
